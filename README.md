# 🌡️ IoT Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

An IoT project using **ESP32** and **DHT11 sensor** to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time.  
The data is displayed via a **web interface** or Wokwi simulation.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring  
- Beginner-friendly IoT project  
- Uses ESP32 and DHT11 sensor  
- Wokwi simulation available  

## 🔗 Simulation Link
[Click here to open Wokwi Simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/442323983587922945)

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP32  
- DHT11 Sensor  
- Jumper Wires  
- Wokwi Simulation Platform  

## 💻 How to Use
1. Open the Wokwi simulation link above.  
2. Upload the `main.ino` code to the ESP32 in the simulation.  
3. Run the simulation and monitor the temperature & humidity readings.  
4. Optional: Connect to a web dashboard or Blynk app for real-time monitoring.
